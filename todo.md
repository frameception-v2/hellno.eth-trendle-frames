Here's the prioritized implementation checklist:

### 1. State Management Foundation
- [x] Create Zustand store with GameState interface in game-store.ts (state container)
- [x] Implement localStorage persistence/loading in game-store.ts (data survival on refresh)
- [x] Add daily solution initialization with timestamp check (daily word rotation)
- [x] Create core actions: addLetter, deleteLetter, submitGuess (game logic)
- [x] Add input validation for 6-letter words (game rules enforcement)

### 2. Grid Core Implementation
- [x] Build GridContainer with CSS Grid layout (desktop-first responsive base)
- [x] Create Tile component with base styling (consistent cell appearance)
- [x] Connect grid to Zustand store guesses/solution (dynamic content rendering)
- [x] Implement empty/partial/filled tile states (visual progress tracking)
- [x] Add basic color classes for correct/incorrect positions (feedback foundation)

### 3. Input System
- [ ] Create Keyboard component with QWERTY layout (input mechanism)
- [ ] Connect keyboard to store's add/delete/submit actions (game interaction)
- [ ] Implement key state tracking (used letters visualization)
- [ ] Add disabled states for game-end scenarios (play control)
- [ ] Add mobile touch event support (cross-device compatibility)

### 4. Game Data Pipeline
- [ ] Implement getDailyWord API service with Axios (dynamic content source)
- [ ] Add localStorage caching with 24h expiry (API failure resilience)
- [ ] Create fallback to local word list (offline capability)
- [ ] Add loading state during word fetch (user feedback)
- [ ] Integrate API service with game store initializer (data flow completion)

### 5. Feedback Enhancements
- [ ] Create flip animation CSS keyframes (visual delight)
- [ ] Implement sequential letter reveal logic (game-like experience)
- [ ] Add useAnimation hook for transition control (systematic animations)
- [ ] Build confetti animation component (win celebration)
- [ ] Optimize animation performance with will-change (smooth rendering)

### 6. Game Completion Flow
- [ ] Create ResultModal component with overlay (endgame UI)
- [ ] Implement share functionality with Warpcast deeplink (social virality)
- [ ] Add guess distribution visualization (performance tracking)
- [ ] Create play again/reset functionality (replayability)
- [ ] Add daily countdown timer (urgency mechanism)

### 7. Mobile Adaptation
- [ ] Implement viewport meta tags (responsive foundation)
- [ ] Add touch action CSS rules (scroll prevention)
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive grid sizing (12vw tiles)
- [ ] Implement input mode validation (virtual keyboard control)
- [ ] Add safe area inset padding (notch/hole punch safety)

### 8. State Hydration
- [ ] Create useHydration hook (client-server sync)
- [ ] Implement URL hash state encoding (shareable games)
- [ ] Add daily word comparator (timezone-aware rotation)
- [ ] Create error boundaries for invalid states (fail-safe)
- [ ] Implement loading transitions (perceived performance)

### 9. Final Polish
- [ ] Connect all components to store (system integration)
- [ ] Add global error boundary (crash protection)
- [ ] Implement CSP headers (security compliance)
- [ ] Add frame meta tags (Farcaster compatibility)
- [ ] Final CSS audit for consistency (pixel perfection)

Implementation order follows: 
1. State → 2. UI → 3. Input → 4. Data → 5. Feedback → 6. Completion → 7. Mobile → 8. Hydration → 9. Polish

Each task builds on previous completion while maintaining isolated testability. Start with game-store.ts implementation first as it's the foundation for all other components.
